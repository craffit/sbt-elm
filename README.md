[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/sutiialex/sbt-elm.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sutiialex/sbt-elm)

An sbt plugin for integrating the elm compiler with Play framework. The plugin looks
for the Main.elm in your assets directory and compiles it into Main.js in your public
assets directory.

For this plugin to work you need to have the elm compiler installed: `npm install -g elm`.

This plugin is not yet integrated in the sbt plugin repository.
